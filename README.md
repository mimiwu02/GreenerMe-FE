# Project 3: Greener Me

## Elevator Pitch
Green Me is an app that promotes a community of traders and growers. Anyone can get into growing their own food. With the fear of food containing GMOs there is a market for this app. The number of farmer markets are increasing which indicates the desire for fresh and non-GMO produce. This app will allow current and new gardeners to get into the habit of growing their own foods to eat healthy, save money, and reduce the impact they have on the environment.


## Background
I remember reading an article about a couple of years ago about Brunei, an oil-rich country located in the South China Sea. The country wanted to improve food security for its people by improving local agriculture such as improving the domesitc rice production. Always thinking ahead, the country analyzed weather data to improve their people's lives. The country is reliant on this data to make accurate predictions on the most optimal time to start growing rice locally. After reading this, I was inspired to do something to make an impact on people's lives by helping them work smarter. I started to realize how popular the farmers markets were amongst my friends because they were all interested in eating more healthy and more organic food. The downside was that it was getting a bit costly. As a result of this, I created this "Greener Me" app to form a community of growers and traders.

This application is in its first iteration so there are more features I would like to add, such as equiping growers the ability to know when the best time it is to start growing vegetables and fruits just as how Brunei does it. The feature would provide weather forecasts and the almanac that spans 10 to 30 years or more.

I am from NYC, so there have been community gardens popping up, which gave me an idea of have an app that will allow traders who have an abundance of a particular vegetable or fruit to be able to find who in their area is willing to make exchanges.

The theme of this app is sustainable living. It will encourage people to grow their own food, which potentially will lead to healthier lifestyles. It is not only good for you but will also be good for the planet as well.


## Technical Details
Greener App is a tool for anyone who wants to eat healthier. It promotes a community for gardeners who are equipped with knowledge to plan out when is the best time to start planting. It also allows growers who have an abundance of a particular vegetable or fruit, a chance to make exchanges. This app leverages:
1. Wunderground Weather API
2. React.js
3. Ruby on Rails
4. SQLite
5. Firebase Database and authentication
6. Bootstrap React
7. Node


## MVP
1. Rails backend for CRUD
  - Create new post and edit post
  - Delete post
  - View all post
  *** Edit, delete only are user specific
2. Use SQL database for storageÂ 
3. Use Firebase for authentication
4. Use an external API to view weather forecast
5. Use React Router for navigation

##Secondary
1. In house emailing capability using Rails (will complete for next iteration of this app)
